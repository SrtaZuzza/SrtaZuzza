    I'm <b>Monica (she/they)</b> a neurodiverse indie game developer and pixel artist who has developed (besides games) a passion towards testing. I am interested in development, quality assurance, quality of life, accessibility and inclusion of minorities. I work on tools that help game developers in my spare time, the vast majority were created using <a href="https://github.com/godotengine" target="_blank">Godot Engine</a>!
